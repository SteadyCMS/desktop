# SteadyCMS desktop

The desktop app for SteadyCMS — a block-based, Hugo static site CMS for desktop and web.

This repository contains the source for the desktop application built with Vue 3 and Electron. 

Status: **Highly work in progress. Not yet ready for use.**


## Roadmap

For now the desktop application is our primary focus, then the web version. 

The immediate goal is to create a simple, block-based frontend for creating and editing posts.
